3.4.4	Jul 2, 2014
	-Bug (dkulp) Fix LOR Import
	The old XML parser, on the start element event, you could query if the element was empty or not.  
	For the "channel" element, if it was empty, we skipped it and didn't map it to a channel.
	The new parser doesn't have that functionality.   I have to record some information at the start tag, 
	determine if there are any effect child elements, and if not, undo some stuff at the end element.   
	The detection and undo wasn't working properly.  Thus, any empty channels in the LMS were getting mapped.   
	Why is this a problem?   Well, LMS has a habit of using extra channels for things.   
	For example, the CCR's which have 50 pixels would normally just be 150 channels.  
	However, in the LMS file, they are 157 channels.  I have no idea what the LR, MM, ME, CM, CS, and CI 
	channels that it puts for each CCR are used for.
	In any case, those extra 7 channels (and any other empty channels) would cause large shifts.    
	This release has changes to fix that.

        -Enh (dkulp) Change XML parser to spxml to avoid loading entire file into memory

	- Bug: (Sean). When exporting HLS sequences if the number of channels was not evely divisible by 3, xLights would crash. Fixed.
	- Enhancement: (Frank). Switched the grids for start channel and custom model to be in scrolling 
		windows so that larger data sets can be handled.
	- Bug: (Matt). Smart RGB arches are only producing a single channel. Fixed
	- Enhancement: (Matt). F1 will bring up help if you are in the Profile tab

3.1.3:  Aug 27,2013 
	- Enhancement: (Matt). New Effect Curtain.
	- Enhancement: (Matt)  New tab PREVIEW. There is a new tab that will allow you to see all of your 
		models displaying effects.

	- Enhancement: (Frankr). Circle effect now has new option called plasma.
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown).  bars compress & expand so that the two halves mirror each other.
	- Bug: (Frankr).  found and fixed the issues with fire and meteors that were being discussed at DIYC.

		can fall to the left or right.
		We have	renamed	Starfield to be called "explode" and "implode"
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown)  I made some improvements to countdown & skip blank cells logic. I also changed 
		a couple of method names to make them more clear. Also, the timer now skips if the last interval takes more than 50ms to process. 
		Before it was blocking until the last interval finished (so if every interval took more than 50ms you had a stackup of waiting timer calls to process).
3.1.0:  Aug 7,2013 	
	- Enhancement: (frankr) new single BACKUP option now.
		Goto to "File,Backup" and every xml file you have will be created in the new Backup sub-directory under show show directory.
		How big are xLight sequences? The xseq file for 12K channels is around 30mbytes, the xml of your sequence is around 30kbytes. As comparison the XML file for LOR for the same song is 800mbytes, for LSP 1.2gbytes. Because xlight sequence files are so small (normally < 50kbytes), we can back them all up quickly.
		How long to back up over 100 sequences? < 1 second.
		How much space does 100 sequences take? < 10 mbytes
		How many times can you do this per day? 1000's. 
		How to use this feature? Just do a "File, Backup" before getting new versions.
		I would do a copy if you plan on doing lots of edits.  Basically get yourself protected.
		So after upgrading to 3.1.0, go and make a copy before opening any sequences
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown) re-engineered the underlying architecture. This is like replacing the galvanized pipe with copper pipe on your home. Takes lots of effort, when you are done the house still looks the same. This re-architecture was needed to allows us to offer new fit to time frame option. With this option effects will be enhanced to do things like start and end exactly to the timing marks on a row. Wait for future releases to see how this is going to help. Trust me, you will like the new things coming.
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown) has enhanced the preview screen so it is multiple times brighter than before. So much nicer now!!
	- Enhancement: (frankr) made it so that when you select none, it will not overwrite existing data. Why do we care? This enhancement means a LSP person could sequence the first 30 seconds of a megatree (mark those rows as none,none in nutcracker). Now fill the rest of the sequence with nutcracker effects. The result? LSP effects will appear for the first 30 seconds, Nutcracker effects will appear for the remainder.
	- Enhancement:(Frankr) enhanced the right click process for protecting a cell. Before you had to get focus on the cell by left clicking (turned it yellow), then you could right click. Now just ricght click any cell, you dont need left click first
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown) made it so effects are now listed alphabetically except for effects current under development (like the piano keyboard)
	- Enhancement: (sean) Sean added Radial 3d Button. Click this button besides the Radial button to get new radial effects
	- Bug Fix: (Sean, Matt, frankkr) . Found more division by zero errors, fixed them.
	- Enhancement: (Sean), For any  person who is pulling code and compiling it (Like MaterDaddy for Linux compiles). I have renamed repository nutcracker_c to be called xLights. Nutcracker_c was just a temp name I was using. I want everyone to remember we started with the xLights code base from Matt Brown in January of this  year. Nutcracker is just one tab on xllights. People get confused is it xLights? Is it Nutcracker? All of nutcracker has been put inside of xLights so the repository should be called the same. Again thanks to Matt for making this all possible. So here is new repository: https://github.com/smeighan/xLights
	- Enhancement: Please start to enter bugs into github so we can track them there. If you want to raise a bug go to https://github.com/smeighan/xLights/issues
	- Bug fix: (Matt) Meteors has been fixed by Matt's rewrite of the preview window. This means the normal Meteor effect is now working again. 
		StarField still does not display on megatrees, it does work on other models.
3.0.24: Aug 4,2013
 	- Enhancement: (frankr) New fade in and fade out boxes on every effect. Enter the number of seconds to either fade in/out.
	- Enhancement: (sean) Started development of Piano Keyboard. This is not complete. Will eventually use an input file from
        Audacity that will identify the polyphonic notes in a song.
	- Enhancement: (matt) Many changes to text. Ghosting is now fixed. You no longer have to use the temporary fix of using
	   "1 is unmask, 2 is color wash". Text now has 45 degrees rotation. Countdown timer can show seconds counting down or
	   it can show "xx d yy h zz m aa s" display. countdown text is now centered correctly.
	- Enhancement: (frankr) New effect for circles. Circles can bounce, collide. Choose radial to make a new effect
	- Bug Fix: (sean) fixed crash when creating random effects. The new effect classes (piano,circles) were causing problem. fixed
	- Bug Fix: (sean) When randomly creating Spirograph effects, the animate button was not being selected. fixed.
	- Enhancement: (frankr) Cells in your effect grid can now be protected/un-protected. Protect a cell and
	   press the "create random effects" and all cells will get a new effect unless the cell is protected.
	   Under Development: Piano Effect. This is NOT done yet. when completed it will animate a piano
	   keyboard.
	- Enhancement: (frankr) Slider next to Layer choice. This slider allows you to pick how much of effect 1 and effect 2 show
	   through.
	
	- UNDER DEVELOPMENT: (sean) Piano Keyboard. Not functional yet. Will be pulled forward into release 25

		change. Now, you will be prompted if you want to save before exit.
	- Enhancement: (frankr) Random effect generation. When creating a Spirograph, the Animate button will always be set and the little radius will be
	  set to its minimum value. By setting r to zero and setting animate to true, random spirographs will now always produce an animation.
	- Enhancement: (frankr) New choice in model generation. You can now select custom. We are not quite done with this but it will support having
	  coro snowflakes, stars, strings wrapped around a car, fire sticks, candles,. Basically any model. Watch this space for a future tutorial.

	- Enhancement: (frankr) In the Model setup screen, you can now set the starting channel for each string
    - Enhancement: (frankr) In the Model setup screen, you can now choose how the strings wrap. 3 more choices are now available
		bottom left, upper left, upper right, bottom right
	- Enhancement: (sean) Meteor Effect class has 3 new effects
